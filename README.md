One of the many pseudonyms I use is WÎžRLDA HÎžRT ( I've used so many over the years that sometimes I forget what my real name is. I think it's Paul... something ðŸ¤”). 

Anyway, I like to think of myself as a coder, but I'd never call myself that in public, it would be an insult to coders!

I use Discord more than Twitter, spend way too much time on YouTube, and know just enough about a lot of subjects to get myself into a lot of trouble. ðŸ˜±

PS. Since I'm writing this on May the 4th, I just have to say that I know the Defiant is impressive, but my favorite Star Trek ship is the Millennium Falcon, sorry Worf!

Skills:  HTML / CSS, Discord, POAPs, etc.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Creating POAPs for my favorite communities.
