# Hi there 👋, my name is WΞRLDA HΞRT

![Welcome to my Github Profile page](https://github.com/RunHot/RunHot/blob/main/github-banner-1.png)

Well, WΞRLDA HΞRT is just one of the many pseudonyms I use ( I've used so many over the years that sometimes I forget what my real name is. I think it's,  Miguel... something 🤔). 

Anyway, I like to think of myself as a coder, but I'd never call myself that in public, it would be an insult to coders.

I use Discord more than Twitter, spend way too much time on YouTube, and know just enough about a lot of subjects to get myself into a lot of trouble! 😱

PS. Since I'm writing this on May the 4th, I just have to say that I know the Defiant is impressive, but my favorite Star Trek ship is the Millennium Falcon, sorry Worf!

## Skills and experience: 

🖥 HTML / CSS, Discord, POAPs, etc.
🎮 I'm in the Upland.me metaverse, and, don't laugh, only now getting into Minecraft!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating POAPs for my favorite communities, and wrapping my head around Linux concepts. 
- 🌱 I’m also studying for my Amateur Extra radio license. 
- 🙏🏼 And I'm always trying to get better at using GitHub.
